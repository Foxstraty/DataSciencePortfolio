Exp#1: Detection of GAN generated images using two-class support vector machine. (SVM). Report Accuracy, F1-score and Recall of the classifier.


Exp#2: Develop a Bagged Version of SVM for the problem in Exp#1. Compare the accuracy, F1-score and recall of the classifier with those obtained in Exp#1.
